# documenter

Documenter is a stupid app that glues together JSON outputs of Spray's web request, then sews them together. There's probably something like this already.

## Installation

What's with all the questions?

## Usage

Running it is easy. Just run

    $ java -jar documenter-0.1.0-standalone.jar 

In a directory filled with specially (undocumented and unspecified) JSON files and everything will (probably?) be fine.


## Options

None. It's stupid.

## Examples

Didn't I explain this already?

### Bugs

Everything.
